1) Choosing container engine wisely-Use Podman rather than docker as it runs rootless containers.
2) Do not mount docker sockets inside containers.(It allows making API calls to docker daemon from within the container. As daemon runs as root so essentially attacker would gain root priviliges by default)
3) Do not give unnecessary capabiliites to containers.
